Machine Instructions:

HALT - Halts program execution by repeatedly loading the current instruction (NOP)
NOP - Empty instruction
FETCH - Moves the data at the address stored in $address to $AC
ADD - Adds the data at the address stored in $address to $AC, storing the result in $AC
NAND - NANDs the data at the address stored in $address to $AC, storing the result in $AC
READ - Stores the value on the input port at the time of execution to $AC
WRITE - Copies the value in $AC at the time of execution to the $OUT register port
BUFF_$AC - Copies the value in $AC to the $address buffer for data memory
BUFF_LIT - Loads the 12 bit literal argument in the instruction into the $address buffer for data memory
STORE - Stores the value in $AC to the address stored in $address in data memory
LOAD - Loads the immediately following word ($PC + 1 in program memory) to $AC
BOF - Branches to the immediately following word in program memory if the data at $address in memory plus $AC yields overflow
BEQ - Branches to the immediately following word in program memory if the data at $address in memory is equal to $AC
JMP - Unconditional branch to the immediately following word in program memory
